I am an undergraduated student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Yingcai Honors College, <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>.
My research interests focus on Alignment in AI, Large Multimodal Models, and Multimodal representation learning.


I previously worked as a machine-learning intern at UESTC, where I had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M7Ocw0YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_blank"> Yazhou Ren</a> 
and  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=obgTcyoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdatet" target="_blank"> Lifang He</a>.  Recently I have the opportunity to work  with  Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=A20BZnQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_blank"> Huaxiu Yao</a>.  
Currently, I am a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.nextcenter.org/" target="_blank"> NEXT++ lab</a>  at the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank"> National University of Singapore</a>  and and I am very fortunate to be advised by  Prof. <a href="https://www.chuatatseng.com/" target="_blank"> Chua Tat Seng</a>  and  <a href="https://anzhang314.github.io/" target="_blank"> An Zhang</a>.
